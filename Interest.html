        <p>  You use the web everyday, but do you understand how Web pages are created? Web pages 
           are created using special language called HTML5. Luckily, learning
            the language is pretty simple and you only need to learn a few stps to get started.</p> 
        <p> What do you need in order to learn HTML5?
         <img src= "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/MultiBrowsers.png" alt=Internet browsers" width="35%" style="float: right;"/></p>

        <ul>  
          <li> A text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, TextWrangler are a few options) or an IDE (integrated develeopment environment)</li>
          <li> A browser (Safari, Chrome, Opera, and Firefox all work here)</li>
          <li> Some pictures to decorate your page</li>
        </ul>
        
        <b>You are to identify the following:</b>
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li> What your interest is</li>
            <li> Why you chose that interest from the list?</li>
            <li> What did you learned from using the WYSIWYG concept of web designing, working on your Google sites project?</li>
          </ol>

        <p> Creating a Web page can be tricky, because one mistake can crash a page.  Just look at
            it as a challenge, make small changes, and test your page often.</p>

        <section>
